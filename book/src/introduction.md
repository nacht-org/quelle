# Introduction

Quelle is an open-source novel scraper and library manager that downloads novels from web sources using WebAssembly extensions. Built with a modular architecture, it provides high performance and cross-platform compatibility for managing your digital novel collection.

## What is Quelle?

Quelle uses a secure, modular extension system where each website gets its own WebAssembly (WASM) extension. This architecture ensures security through sandboxing while making it easy to add support for new sources.

**Key Features:**
- **Secure**: Extensions run in a WebAssembly sandbox for complete isolation
- **Fast**: Built with Rust for maximum performance
- **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Extensible**: Easy-to-use extension system with development tools
- **Full Library Management**: Search, download, organize, and export your collection
- **Multiple Formats**: Export to EPUB, PDF, and other formats
- **Auto-Updates**: Keep your library current with new chapters
