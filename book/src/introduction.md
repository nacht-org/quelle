# Introduction

Welcome to Quelle, an open-source, extensible, and portable e-book scraper that enables users to download e-books from multiple online sources. Built with Rust and WebAssembly, Quelle provides a powerful yet flexible platform for accessing digital content from various web novel and e-book platforms.

## What is Quelle?

Quelle is designed with modularity and extensibility at its core. Rather than being limited to specific websites or formats, Quelle uses a plugin-based architecture where each source is implemented as a WebAssembly (WASM) extension. This approach provides several key benefits:

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: WASM extensions run consistently across different operating systems
- **Security**: Extensions are sandboxed and cannot access system resources beyond what's explicitly allowed
- **Performance**: Native-level performance with the safety of managed execution
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add support for new sources without modifying the core engine

## Key Features

### Modular Architecture
- **Engine**: Core runtime built with Wasmtime for loading and managing extensions
- **Extensions**: Individual WASM components for different e-book sources
- **Store System**: Comprehensive package management for discovering, installing, and updating extensions
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line tools for all operations

### Store System
The store system is one of Quelle's most powerful features, providing:

- **Multiple Store Types**: Local file systems, Git repositories, HTTP registries
- **Package Management**: Install, update, and remove extensions with dependency resolution
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with conflict resolution
- **Search and Discovery**: Find extensions across multiple stores with advanced filtering
- **Security**: Checksum verification and trusted store management

### Supported Operations
- Search for novels across multiple sources
- Download complete novels with all chapters
- Export to multiple formats (EPUB, PDF, plain text, Markdown)
- Batch operations for multiple novels
- Resume interrupted downloads

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Current Status**: Pre-MVP Development

Quelle is currently under active development. The core architecture is in place and functional, including:

- âœ… Core WASM runtime engine
- âœ… Extension loading system
- âœ… Complete store management system
- âœ… CLI interface for store and extension management
- âœ… Sample extensions (dragontea, scribblehub)

### What's Coming
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced CLI interface for novel operations
- ðŸ”„ Multiple output formats (EPUB, PDF, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Cross-platform binaries
- ðŸ”„ Git and HTTP store implementations
- ðŸ”„ Web interface
