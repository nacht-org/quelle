## Current Limitations

### What Works
- ‚úÖ Fetching novel info from URLs
- ‚úÖ Fetching chapter content
- ‚úÖ Basic search (if extension supports it)
- ‚úÖ Store and extension management
- ‚úÖ Two working extensions (DragonTea, ScribbleHub)

### What's Missing
- ‚ùå Downloading complete novels
- ‚ùå Exporting to EPUB/PDF
- ‚ùå Batch operations
- ‚ùå Resume interrupted downloads
- ‚ùå Advanced search across multiple sites
- ‚ùå Built-in extension repository

## Tips

1. **Always check status first** with `quelle status` to see what's configured
2. **URLs matter** - make sure you're using URLs that your extensions support
3. **Extensions auto-install** - if you fetch from a URL and the extension exists in a store, it installs automatically
4. **Local stores are simple** - just directories with WASM files for now
5. **Build before use** - remember to build extensions with `just build-extension <name>`

## Troubleshooting

### "No extension found for URL"
- Make sure you have extensions built and available in stores
- Check that the URL matches what the extension supports
- Run `quelle list` to see available extensions

### Extension errors
- Check that the extension was built successfully
- Verify the website URL is correct and accessible
- Some sites may block automated access

### Store issues
- Run `quelle store health` to check connectivity
- Make sure store directories exist and have proper permissions
- Check `quelle store list` to see configured stores
