## The Question

**Should we streamline the StoreProvider trait?**

**Answer:** Yes - it has design issues worth fixing.

## The Problems

1. **Read-only providers do unnecessary work** - Must implement write methods they never use
2. **Duplicate operations** - Same logic written multiple times
3. **Can't query capabilities** - No way to discover provider features

## The Solution

Split into focused traits:
- Core operations (required)
- Metadata (required)
- Write operations (optional)
- Capabilities (queryable)

## The Approach

**Phase 1 (Now):** Add new methods, deprecate old ones - No breaking changes
**Phase 2 (Next major version):** Complete the split - Breaking but managed

## The Impact

- Read-only providers: 50% less boilerplate
- Writable providers: 30% less code, no duplication
- Everyone: Future-proof extensibility

## Recommendation

✅ **Approve Phase 1** - Safe, immediate value
✅ **Approve Phase 2** - Proper long-term design
