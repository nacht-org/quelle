# Quelle

This project provides an open-source, extensible and portable application that enables users to scrape e-books from multiple online sources. With its flexibility and support for multiple online sources, this e-book scraper provides a valuable tool for e-book enthusiasts who want to easily search and download e-books from the internet.

The repository holds both the Rust source code for the extensions and the runtime built using Wasmtime. This architecture allows for high-performance execution and cross-platform compatibility, making the application efficient and versatile.

## Project Architecture

Quelle uses a modular WebAssembly-based architecture:

- **Engine (`crates/engine`)**: Core runtime built with Wasmtime that loads and manages extensions
- **Extension Framework (`crates/extension`)**: Shared library for building WASM extensions
- **Extensions (`extensions/`)**: Individual scrapers for different e-book sources (dragontea, scribblehub)
- **WIT Interfaces (`wit/`)**: WebAssembly Interface Types defining the contract between engine and extensions

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Project Status**: Pre-MVP Development

This project is currently under active development. The core architecture is in place, but the MVP is not yet complete.

## Documentation

ðŸ“š **Comprehensive documentation is available in the [Quelle Book](./book/)**

The book contains detailed guides for users, developers, and contributors:

- **User Guide**: Installation, getting started, and basic usage
- **Store System**: Extension package management and CLI reference  
- **Development**: Architecture, extension development, and API reference
- **Reference**: Quick reference, troubleshooting, and technical details

Since Quelle is under active development, the documentation reflects current capabilities while noting planned features.

### What Works
- âœ… Core WASM runtime engine
- âœ… Extension loading system
- âœ… Basic WIT interface definitions
- âœ… Sample extensions (dragontea, scribblehub)

### What's Coming
- ðŸ”„ Complete CLI interface
- ðŸ”„ Multiple output formats (EPUB, PDF, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Extension management system
- ðŸ”„ Cross-platform binaries
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive documentation

## MVP Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- **CLI Interface Enhancement**
  - Comprehensive command-line interface with `search`, `download`, `list-sources`, `install-extension` commands
  - Configuration file support and progress indicators
- **Extension System Refinement**
  - Dynamic extension discovery and management
  - Extension metadata and validation system
- **WIT Interface Completion**
  - Review and enhance interface definitions
  - Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: Extension Development
- **Expand Existing Extensions**
  - Complete DragonTea and ScribbleHub implementations
  - Add search, metadata extraction, and chapter downloading
- **Add New Extensions** (3-4 popular sources from):
  - NovelFull, ReadLightNovel, Wuxiaworld, Royal Road, Archive.org, Project Gutenberg
- **Quality Assurance**
  - Test suites, integration tests, and performance optimization

### Phase 3: User Experience
- **Multiple Export Formats**: EPUB, PDF, plain text, Markdown
- **Enhanced Search**: Multi-source aggregation, filtering, caching
- **Download Management**: Batch downloads, resume capability, queue management

### Phase 4: Documentation & Distribution
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Installation guides, tutorials, troubleshooting
- **Build Pipeline**: CI/CD with cross-platform binaries
- **Extension Ecosystem**: Registry, packaging standards, contribution guidelines

### MVP Success Criteria
- âœ… Successfully download complete e-books from 5+ sources

## Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nacht-org/quelle
cd quelle

# Build an extension
just build-extension dragontea

# Run the engine (when CLI is complete)
cargo run -p quelle_engine -- --help
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here are ways you can help:

### Priority Areas for MVP
1. **Extension Development**: Add support for new e-book sources
2. **CLI Enhancement**: Improve user interface and experience
3. **Output Formats**: Implement EPUB, PDF generation
4. **Testing**: Add tests for existing functionality
5. **Documentation**: Improve guides and examples

### Development Setup
1. Install Rust (latest stable)
2. Install `just` command runner: `cargo install just`
3. Install WASM target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
4. Install `cargo-component`: `cargo install cargo-component`

### Building Extensions
```bash
# Build a specific extension
just build-extension <extension-name>

# Example
just build-extension dragontea
```

### Contribution Guidelines
- Follow Rust coding standards and run `cargo fmt`
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for user-facing changes
- Extensions should handle rate limiting and respect robots.txt
- Ensure legal compliance with targeted sites' terms of service

### Extension Development
To create a new extension:
1. Copy an existing extension as a template
2. Implement the required WIT interfaces
3. Add appropriate error handling and logging
4. Test thoroughly with the target site
5. Add documentation and examples

See the [Extension Development Guide](./book/src/development/extension-development.md) and existing extensions in `extensions/` for reference implementations.
