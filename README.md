### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up Quelle
just setup

# 2. Search for a novel
quelle search "overlord light novel" --limit 5

# 3. Add a novel to your library
quelle add https://www.scribblehub.com/series/123456/overlord/

# 4. Read the first chapter
quelle read "Overlord" 1

# 5. Export to EPUB for your e-reader
quelle export "Overlord" --format epub --output ./books/

# 6. Keep your library updated
quelle update

# 7. Manage extension stores (optional)
quelle store list                   # See available stores
quelle extensions search "royal"    # Search for more extensions
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Quelle uses a modular WebAssembly-based architecture with a distributed extension system:

- **CLI (`crates/cli`)**: User interface and command handling
- **Engine (`crates/engine`)**: Core runtime built with Wasmtime
- **Extension Framework (`crates/extension`)**: Shared library for WASM extensions  
- **Storage (`crates/storage`)**: Data persistence and library management
- **Store System (`crates/store`)**: Extension package management
- **Extensions (`extensions/`)**: Individual scrapers (dragontea, scribblehub)
- **WIT Interfaces (`wit/`)**: WebAssembly Interface Types definitions

### Extension Distribution
- **Official Registry**: [github.com/nacht-org/extensions](https://github.com/nacht-org/extensions) (configured by default)
- **Local Development**: Build and publish extensions locally for testing  
- **Custom Stores**: Add additional Git repositories or local directories

```bash
# View configured stores (official registry included by default)
quelle store list

# Add a custom extension store
quelle store add git custom-store https://github.com/user/my-extensions

# Search across all stores
quelle extensions search "light novel"

# Install from any configured store  
quelle extensions install custom.extension
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust and required tools
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install just cargo-component
```

### Extension Development Workflow

```bash
# Validate extension structure and build
just dev-validate scribblehub

# Quick test novel info fetching
just dev-test-novel scribblehub "https://www.scribblehub.com/series/123456/novel/"

# Quick test search functionality  
just dev-test-search scribblehub "fantasy adventure"

# Start development server with hot reload
just dev-server scribblehub
```

The development server provides:
- **Hot reload**: Automatic rebuild on file changes
- **Interactive testing**: Test novel fetching, search, and chapters
- **Real-time feedback**: Detailed timing and error information
- **Pure extensions**: No debugging code needed in extensions

### Creating New Extensions

1. Copy an existing extension as template
2. Implement the required WIT interfaces
3. Test with development tools: `just dev-validate <name>`
4. Publish: `just publish <name>`

üìñ **[Complete Extension Development Guide](./docs/EXTENSION_DEVELOPMENT.md)**

### Publishing Extensions

#### Automated Publishing (GitHub Actions)

Extensions are automatically published to the [official store](https://github.com/nacht-org/extensions) through multiple triggers:

- **PR Merge**: Triggered when pull requests with extension changes are merged
- **Release**: Publishes all extensions when a new release is created
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch with options for specific or all extensions
- **Local Testing**: Use the provided script for development

The automated workflow:
1. Detects which extensions have changed (or all for releases)
2. Builds each extension to WebAssembly
3. Publishes to the official store with proper authentication
4. Creates build artifacts and summaries

#### Local Publishing Script

Use the provided script for local development and testing:

```bash
# Basic usage
./scripts/publish-extension.sh scribblehub

# Publish to local store with overwrite
./scripts/publish-extension.sh --store local --overwrite scribblehub

# Dry run (build but don't publish)
./scripts/publish-extension.sh --dry-run scribblehub

# With notes and tags
./scripts/publish-extension.sh --notes "Bug fixes" --tags "manga,novels" scribblehub

# Show help and available extensions
./scripts/publish-extension.sh --help
```

#### Manual Publishing Options

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- **Auto-Publish Extensions**: Manual dispatch with option to publish all extensions

**Local Scripts:**
- Use for immediate testing and development iterations
- Full control over store, notes, tags, and dry-run options

#### Requirements for Official Publishing

To publish extensions to the official store automatically:

1. **Repository Setup**: Fork or contribute to this repository
2. **GitHub Token**: Set `EXTENSIONS_PUBLISH_TOKEN` secret with write access to `nacht-org/extensions`
3. **Extension Structure**: Follow the existing extension patterns in `extensions/`
4. **Testing**: Ensure extensions build successfully with `just build-extension <name>`

#### Publishing Workflow

**Development ‚Üí Production:**
1. Create feature branch with extension changes
2. Test locally with `./scripts/publish-extension.sh --dry-run <name>`
3. Create pull request
4. Merge PR ‚Üí Automatic publishing triggered
5. Extensions available in official store immediately

**Batch Updates:**
- Create release ‚Üí All extensions published together
